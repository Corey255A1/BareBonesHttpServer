A Very minimal. Insecure. Incomplete. Easy To Use. .Net Standard 2.0. Http Server. Serve up some pages for your amusement

I want a way to serve up some basic webpages from a UWP app, but currently the built in HttpListener is 
only part of the .Net Framework.
So I dug in and am learning how Http Works to build a very rough and simple Http Server for my purposes.
Not intended to be used for production Websites
Not intended to be secure
Not intended to be flexible

Just a easy way to add serving up webpages from your .Net application either for diagnostics, control, 
or distributive local viewing
